<p>My name's Craig. IÊ¼m a software engineer searching for a full-time position to kick-start
  my career in tech in an Agile company. I love learning new skills, have a strong problemsolving mindset coupled
  with a proven adaptation capacity, and thrive in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p>After several years in the music and sales industry, I decided to take a
  leap of faith and change my life around by learning how to code. In
2021 I started independently teaching myself Python in an attempt to
embark on this journey. After being selected from 1800+ applicants I
joined the School of Code full-time intensive BootCamp and with that
have embarked on a life-changing journey that has developed me
personally, mentally but most importantly professionally.</p>
